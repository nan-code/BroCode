React project utilizing

UIKit (https://getuikit.com/)
AirBNB libraries (https://github.com/airbnb/) such as the calendar (https://github.com/airbnb/react-dates)
Otherwise might use (https://github.com/clauderic/react-infinite-calendar/)


Also, considering:

Ant - https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce (great out of the box styling, less customization)
Semantic UI - https://react.semantic-ui.com/introduction (lack of accessibility, but good customization)
Grommet - http://grommet.io/docs/components (supports more customization and accessibility)
Bootstrap (ah, a classic) - https://react-bootstrap.github.io/ (similar to Grommet, but worse out of the box styling)
Atlas Kit - https://ak-mk-2-prod.netlify.com/packages (good docs?)
Spectre CSS - https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/getting-started.html (super lightweight)


Useful tools:

React Scripts (with built in babel/webpack support) - https://github.com/kitze/custom-react-scripts
